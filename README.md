`Flammenwerfer Plugin` is a [Frosty v1](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite) plugin adaptation of [flammenwerfer](https://github.com/BF1CHS/flammenwerfer/).

## About
- **FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader**: Modified from the `FsLocalizationPlugin`, designed to replace it. They are compatible with each other's projects and mods, but cannot be used at the same time. This plugin supports automatically modifying the histogram to allowing the game to display unsupported characters, and merging multiple mods that modify LocalizedString, even if they were exported with `FsLocalizationPlugin`.
- **FlammenwerferPlugin.Editor**: Modified from the `LocalizedStringPlugin`, designed to replace it. They can be used at the same time, but it is not recommended. This plugin supports import/export of JSON, CSV, and XLS(X) files.
- You can use only one of them. `FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader` supports `LocalizedStringPlugin`, and `FlammenwerferPlugin.Editor` supports `FsLocalizationPlugin`.
- Mod Manager only needs `FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader`. Feel free to include this plugin with your mod distribution, but it is better to indicate the GitHub link to this repo and [flammenwerfer](https://github.com/BF1CHS/flammenwerfer/), and remember to keep it updated.
- You will only need

## Install
### FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader
- Delete or disable `FsLocalizationPlugin.dll` from your `Plugins` folder under **Frosty**.
- Download the `FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader.dll` from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/shoushou1106/FrostyFlammenwerferPlugin/releases) and place the .dll file in the `Plugins` folder under **Frosty**.
### FlammenwerferPlugin.Editor
- (Optional) Delete or disable `LocalizedStringPlugin.dll` from your `Plugins` folder under **Frosty Editor**.
- Download the `FlammenwerferPlugin.Editor.zip` from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/shoushou1106/FrostyFlammenwerferPlugin/releases). Extract and place `all` the .dll files in the `Plugins` folder under **Frosty Editor**.

## Build
For easy installation, [ILRepack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) will be used after building. The following are sample steps (for myself):
- Put the two built DLLs, Frosty, and the ILRepack executable in the same directory.
- Run the following command:
```shell
ILRepack /out:FlammenwerferPluginLoader_ILRepack.dll FlammenwerferPlugin.Loader.dll FlammenwerferPlugin.Flammen.dll
```
